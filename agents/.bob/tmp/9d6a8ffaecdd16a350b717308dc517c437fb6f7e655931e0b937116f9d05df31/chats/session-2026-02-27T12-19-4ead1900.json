This guide walks you through the installation process and initial setup.\n\n\n## System requirements\n\n- Node.js version 22.15 or later\n- One of the following operating systems: macOS, Linux, Windows, z/OS, Linux on Z\n\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall Bob-Shell using one of the following methods:\n\n\n## Using the Command Palette\n\nIf you have Bob installed, you can install Bob-Shell directly from the Command Palette:\n\n1. Open the Command Palette (press `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).\n2. Type and select:\n   ```\n   run bobshell\n   ```\n\n\n## macOS and Linux\n\n```bash\ncurl -s https://s3.us-south.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/bobshell/install-bobshell.sh | bash\n```\n\nif you have multiple package managers, you can pre selected package manager:\n```bash\ncurl -s https://s3.us-south.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/bobshell/install-bobshell.sh | bash -s -- --pm pnpm\n```\n\n\n## Windows\n\n```powershell\npowershell -ep Bypass 'irm -Uri \"https://s3.us-south.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/bobshell/install-bobshell.ps1\" | iex'\n```\n\nif you have multiple package managers, you can pre selected package manager (needs at least powershell v3):\n```powershell\npowershell -ep Bypass 'iex \"& {$(irm \"https://s3.us-south.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/bobshell/install-bobshell.ps1\")} -pm pnpm\"'\n```\n\nBob-Shell updates automatically. When a new update is available, restart Bob-Shell to apply the update.\n\n\n## Authentication\n\nTo use Bob-Shell, you will be prompted to authenticate via w3id SSO. \nBob-Shell will try to automatically open a browser for you to authenticate. If that fails it will display a link that you need to open.\n\n\nIf you still need to use Bob-Shell with api-key:\n* export BOBSHELL_API_KEY=abc123\n* bob --auth-method api-key\n\n\n## File references\n\nYou can reference files in your prompts using the `@` symbol, just like in Bob's interactive mode:\n\n```bash\nbob -p \"Explain the code in @src/main.js\"\n```\n\n\n## Safety features\n\nBy default, Bob-Shell only uses \"non-destructive\" tools (e.g., \"read file\") in non-interactive mode. To enable writing and updating files, specify `--yolo` when you invoke Bob-Shell:\n\n```bash\nbob -p \"Fix the bugs in @src/main.js\" --yolo\n```\n\n> **Note:** Even with `yolo` mode enabled, Bob-Shell will **not** write or update files outside the directory where Bob-Shell was started.\n\n\n## Processing output\n\nThe output contains both Bob-Shell's answer along with its \"thinking\" steps. To make subsequent processing of the result easier, add an instruction like _Enclose the answer in markdown tags_:\n\n```bash\nbob -p \"What Java version is this application for? Use the info in @pom.xml. Enclose the answer in markdown tags\" > ../bobresp.txt\n```\n\nExample result:\n```\nI'll check the Java version specified in the pom.xml file:I need to provide the absolute path to read the pom.xml file:\n```markdown\nThis application is built for Java 8, as specified in the pom.xml file with the following compiler settings:\n<maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>\n<maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>\n```\n```\n\n\n## Next steps\n\n- [Starting and using Bob-Shell in interactive mode](start-bobshell-interactive.md)\n- [Starting and using Bob-Shell in non-interactive mode](start-bobshell-non-interactive.md)\n- [Using slash commands in Bob-Shell](slash-commands-bobshell.md)\n\n"
