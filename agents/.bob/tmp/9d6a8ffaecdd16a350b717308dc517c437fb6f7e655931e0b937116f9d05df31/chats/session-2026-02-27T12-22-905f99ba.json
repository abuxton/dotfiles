Once you've received the results of tool uses and can confirm that the task is complete, use this tool to briefly summarize the completion of the task to the user. Do not use it until previous tool uses reported the status \"Success\". Optionally you may provide a CLI command to showcase the result of your work. If the user requested a specific output, display the output exactly as requested without any extra text. If the task is a question that can be answered without additional information, you *must* DIRECTLY use attempt_completion tool.",
